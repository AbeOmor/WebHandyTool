\section{Significant Risks}
The previous implementation of this application requires a third-party package know as BeautifulSoup. If we are forced to also rely on this as well it could severely limit the final product's portability.\\

Implementing a web crawler also has the potential to be difficult due to the fact that no member of the group has prior experience developing one. Also, on larger websites, it becomes challenging to efficiently crawl through due to the sheer number of links that exist.\\

\section{Demonstration}
We will be demonstrating a small, simple web crawler with minimal functionality. This demonstrates that the team possesses the basic knowledge necessary in order to complete the project.
