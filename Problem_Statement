 Problem Statement }

\maketitle
Problem we are trying to solve?\newline

When someone navigates through the web, it is sometimes difficult to locate pertinent information using standard methods of search such as search engine. This issue effects those trying to research existing information on the web as well as developers trying to verify webpage functionality\newline

\maketitle
Why is this an important problem?\newline

As the world-wide web increases in size, it's becoming more cumbersome for users to sift through links and find useful information on the web that is related to their search item. Due to the inefficiency of current methods it is excessively time consuming to carry of these tasks. By decreasing the amount of time spent on these trivial tasks, individuals can allocate this time to more consequential matters.  \newline

\maketitle
What is the context of the problem you are solving?\newline

Researchers, developers and their employers will benefit from our solution. We will be focusing on implementing the core functionality of a web crawler as the primary objective with secondary functionality added in if time permits. \newline
Researchers will be able to search through websites to find important information and download all the resources at once. \newline
Developers crawl through a website in order to map its structure, check status code on links and possibly download resources available on the site.\newline
Companies will be able to save money and resources because their employees will spend less time and effort on trivial tasks such as, webpage link validation. \newline 
Given various starting details, maps the links of a given website as well as notifying the user of any errors arising from those links.\newline
Stakeholders of the project, as of this moment, are researchers, developers, and companies. \newline
